### math-phys
In this project I share some math or physics related documents that I have created just for fan and
little bit for mind exercise and to keep my knowledge in those areas fresh as well as maintain related programs' 
usage knowledge up to date. Documents are not usable for any scientists or researchers, they are mostly some exercises solutions. 
Only students that are learning from mentioned books may make some use of included documents.
If you notice any errors in documents or have any suggestions etc. please feel free to log "issue" in this project.  
Note: I noticed some PDF documents' rendering issues when documents are being viewed directly on github web page.
If you want to read documents - download them locally.

Currently all papers are in polish language - so sorry this project is currently only for polish speaking people.

List of included documents:
- **KolodziejRozwiazania.pdf** (polish, not finished) - Rozwiązania Zadań z książki: _Witold Kołodziej, Analiza Matematyczna_
- **ResnickRozwiazania.pdf** (polish, not finished) - Rozwiązania Zadań z książki: _D.Halliday, R.Resnick, J.Walker Podstawy Fizyki_
